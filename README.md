Here I bild a small funny project named - CloudFunFact 
This shows one line facts or meme on AWS cloud by clicking the button one by one.
In this I used AWS cloud services like DynamoDB, Lambda, API gateway .
DynamoDB table store all my facts in linear form.
Lambda creats a function to facth the items of DynamoDB table .
Then I created an API so that the Fun-Fact Generator can be accessed from any frontend, mobile app, website, or even other services.
Mapping all the resources in integration response and method response.
then write a html code on visual studio code just to visually represents my Project.
and run it on server and finally it's working!
